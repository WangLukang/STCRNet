# STCRNetï¼šA Semi-Supervised Network Based on Self-Training and Consistency Regularization for Change Detection in Remote Sensing Images

Welcome to the initial version of our project!

**Note:** This release represents an initial version of the project. The method's steps are not fully integrated yet, and automation is currently lacking. We plan to release a more automated version in the near future.

## Project Overview

This project aims to provide a solution for semi-supervised change detection tasks. The current code version can perform semi-supervised change detection tasks, but it might involve a bit more manual effort.

## Usage Steps

1. Run `train_URNet.py` to train the initial model F1 and generate model checkpoints. Select the parameters of the 30th, 40th, and 50th epochs as the checkpoints.
2. Execute `test.py` to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data. Use `Grad_CAM.py` to create class activation maps.
3. Utilize `MerIoU.py` to identify reliable unlabeled data.
4. Use `train_consitency.py` to train the re-trained model.
5. Evaluate the model's performance using `metric_total.py`.
